# Module OpenAPI Kotlin Generator

OpenAPI Kotlin Generator is a code generator that generates code from the `OpenAPI Typed` ADT.

## Roadmap: KotlinPoet-free, KMP-compatible Generator
A new plan has been drafted to create a Kotlin Multiplatform-compatible generation module that does not depend on KotlinPoet. This plan focuses on a minimal IR and emitter-based approach, incremental milestones, and smooth integration with the existing parser, typed models, and Gradle plugin.

See the detailed plan: [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md)
