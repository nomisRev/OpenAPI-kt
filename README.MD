**WORK IN PROGRESS**

OpenKTTP is a toolset for working with OpenAPI in Kotlin.
This project exists out of several pieces, and they can be combined in different ways to achieve different goals.

- Core: A OpenAPI parser, and typed ADT based on KotlinX Serialization
- OpenAPI Typed: A version of the `Core` ADT, structures the data in a convenient way to retrieve.
- Generator: A code generator that generates code from the `OpenAPI Typed` ADT
- Gradle Plugin: Gradle plugin to conveniently generate clients

## Code Generation

Add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file.

```kotlin
plugin {
  id("io.github.nomisrev.openapi.plugin") version "0.0.1"
}

openApiConfig {
  spec.set(file("openapi.json"))
}
```

Then run the following command to generate the code.

```shell
./gradlew generateOpenApi
```

This will generate a `io.github.nomisrev.openapi` package with the generated code,
in your `/build/generated` directory.
